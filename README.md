# User Specification:
'Virtual Volunteer' app used by Parkrun is a great example
## Core Features

### A user must be able to:
  * Start a race timer 
  * Record the finish time of each runner in that race
  * Submit results to a server
  * Clear race results from their device after the race

### The mobile app must be able to:
  * Record race results on a phone that is in "airplane mode" - i.e. offline
  * Store data from one race at a time.
  * Provide timing for races up to 24 hours in length
  * Upload race results to a server (either live during the race and/or as a batch upload afterwards if data is recorded in "airplane mode")

### The server should:
  * Receive data from users
  * Display race results
  * Provide timely results (as data is uploaded or immediately after, so runners can see their official positions and times before they go home).

## Additional Considerations And Features

##### Try to think of novel additions and use cases for this app, some examples of advanced features that could be included are:

  *  Exporting results to a spreadsheet, possibly using Comma Separated Variable (CSV) format.
  *  Share the race start time so other app users around the course can know when to expect the first runners.
  *  Provide timing screens at checkpoints and at the finish.
  *  Provide a URL for spectators to visit so they can track the face time and finishers.
  *  Provide a capability for marshalls at random checkpoints to record the numbers of runners who pass them, the race-time of the event, and the location of the marshall - this can be useful in longer races to provide rigorous evidence of fair race completion by competitors.
