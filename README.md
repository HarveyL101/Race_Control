# Race Control - by UP2118183
(This documentation is currently a WIP, if not already apparent)

## Assumptions
All assumptions of logic and/ or  physical race organisation will be mentioned here.

* Assumption 1: 
  * Each runner can at least access the internet at least twice before they leave the premises of the race (once to enter, once to submit all results).

* Assumption 2:
  * There will be at least one volunteer at each race to tell runners to exit the track upon being disqualified, and to announce the winner to all participants

* Assumption 3: 
  * This volunteer can also access the internet at least once, in order to remove any anomalous lap recordings

## Key features: 

### Login/ Register Page
  *  capable of both logging in/ registering through the use of interchanging custom HTML elements

### Dashboard 
  * This uses dynamic text, addressing the user with their username in common welcome messages

## AI
Replace this with DETAIL about your use of AI, listing of the prompts you used, and whether the results formed or inspired part of your final submission and where we can see this (and if not, why not?). You may wish to group prompts into headings/sections - use markdown in any way that it helps you communicate your use of AI.  Tell us about what went right,  what went horribly wrong and what you learned from it.


### Prompts to develop XYZ (example)
#### Prompt ideas:
using sqlite
A sequence of prompts helped me develop this feature:


>  this is an example prompt given to a chatbot
The response was proved useless because the prompt wasn't specific enough about XYZ, so:

>  this is an example prompt given to a chatbot detailing XYZ
The response was better so I could specifically ask about QRST - this may evolve into a longer discussion highlighting some insight you gained… who knows where you might pick up marks!

>  how can I integrate QRST here?
The suggestion worked with minor modifications.

### Prompts to develop GHIJ (example)
For the GHIJ feature I ...
